# Survival Mechanics

**Date:** 2025-11-24  
**Status:** Planning

## Core Survival Systems

### Health System
- **Health Points (HP)** - Primary survival metric
- **Regeneration** - Slow natural regen when well-fed/rested
- **Damage sources** - Combat, environmental hazards, starvation, etc.
- **Status effects** - Poison, radiation, bleeding, etc.
- **Medical items** - Bandages, medkits, antidotes

### Hunger System
- **Hunger meter** - Decreases over time
- **Food consumption** - Eating restores hunger
- **Starvation** - Health loss when hunger reaches zero
- **Food types** - Different foods provide different benefits
- **Food preservation** - Some foods spoil over time
- **Cooking** - Prepare better meals for more benefits

### Thirst System
- **Thirst meter** - Decreases faster than hunger
- **Water sources** - Find clean water or purify dirty water
- **Dehydration** - Health loss when thirst reaches zero
- **Water quality** - Dirty water may cause illness
- **Water storage** - Containers for carrying water

### Temperature System
- **Body temperature** - Affected by environment
- **Heat** - Overheating in hot biomes/areas
- **Cold** - Hypothermia in cold biomes/areas
- **Clothing/armor** - Provides temperature protection
- **Shelter** - Buildings provide temperature control
- **Fire/heat sources** - Warm up in cold areas
- **Cooling** - Ways to cool down in hot areas

### Additional Survival Needs

#### Sleep/Rest
- **Fatigue** - Builds up over time
- **Sleep requirement** - Need to rest periodically
- **Sleep benefits** - Restores health, reduces fatigue
- **Sleep locations** - Beds provide better rest
- **Sleep deprivation** - Penalties for not sleeping

#### Radiation Exposure
- **Radiation meter** - Accumulates in radiation zones
- **Radiation damage** - Health loss over time
- **Protection** - Lead armor, hazmat suits
- **Radiation sickness** - Status effects at high exposure
- **Decontamination** - Ways to reduce radiation

#### Oxygen/Air Quality
- **Toxic atmospheres** - Some areas have bad air
- **Gas masks** - Required in toxic zones
- **Filter durability** - Masks need maintenance
- **Underwater** - Breath holding mechanics
- **Oxygen tanks** - Extended underwater exploration

#### Sanity/Mental Health (Optional)
- **Stress meter** - Builds from danger, isolation
- **Stress effects** - Visual/audio hallucinations, penalties
- **Stress relief** - Rest, comfort items, social interaction (if multiplayer)

## Difficulty Level: Harder Side

### Challenge Factors
- **Fast resource depletion** - Resources deplete quickly
- **Harsh penalties** - Mistakes are costly
- **Limited resources** - Scarcity creates challenge
- **Multiple threats** - Balance multiple survival needs
- **Environmental dangers** - World itself is hostile
- **Enemy difficulty** - Strong, adaptive enemies

### Balance Considerations
- **Fair but challenging** - Difficult but not unfair
- **Player agency** - Skill and preparation matter
- **Recovery possible** - Can recover from mistakes (with respawn)
- **Progression helps** - Better gear/tech makes survival easier
- **No artificial difficulty** - Challenges make sense in-world

## Death & Respawn System

### Death Mechanics
- **Death causes** - Health reaches zero, extreme conditions
- **Death penalties** - Lose items? Lose progress? (to be determined)
- **Death screen** - Show cause of death, stats, options

### Respawn Options

#### Respawn Types
1. **Bed/Spawn Point**
   - Set custom respawn location
   - Requires building a bed
   - Can have multiple beds
   - Choose which to respawn at

2. **Last Safe Location**
   - Respawn at last "safe" area
   - Defined by player actions (rested, built shelter, etc.)
   - Automatic fallback

3. **World Spawn**
   - Respawn at world starting point
   - Always available
   - May be far from progress

4. **Checkpoint System**
   - Respawn at checkpoints
   - May be story/quest related
   - Strategic placement

#### Respawn Mechanics
- **Item retention** - Keep items on death? (full, partial, or drop)
- **Progress retention** - Keep exploration, crafting recipes, etc.
- **Experience loss** - Lose XP on death? (if XP system exists)
- **Cooldown** - Time before can respawn? (prevents abuse)

### Hardcore Mode (Optional)
- **Permadeath** - One life, game over on death
- **Separate save** - Different from normal mode
- **Achievement/reward** - Special recognition for hardcore play

## Survival Balance

### Resource Scarcity
- **Gathering rates** - How fast can you gather resources?
- **Consumption rates** - How fast do resources deplete?
- **Storage limits** - How much can you carry/store?
- **Resource distribution** - Where are resources located?

### Crafting & Preparation
- **Crafting recipes** - Tools, weapons, survival items
- **Preparation time** - Time to craft, cook, prepare
- **Resource management** - Balance gathering vs. consumption
- **Efficiency improvements** - Better tools = better gathering

### Risk vs. Reward
- **Dangerous areas** - Higher risk, better rewards
- **Safe areas** - Lower risk, fewer resources
- **Exploration rewards** - Finding new areas provides benefits
- **Combat rewards** - Defeating enemies provides resources

## UI/UX for Survival

### HUD Elements
- **Health bar** - Current health, max health
- **Hunger meter** - Visual indicator
- **Thirst meter** - Visual indicator
- **Temperature indicator** - Current temp, comfort zone
- **Status effects** - Icons for active effects
- **Radiation meter** - If in radiation zone
- **Oxygen/air quality** - If relevant

### Warnings & Alerts
- **Low health warning** - Visual/audio alert
- **Hunger/thirst warnings** - When getting low
- **Temperature warnings** - Extreme temps
- **Radiation warnings** - Entering radiation zones
- **Status effect notifications** - When effects are applied

### Inventory Management
- **Survival items** - Quick access to food, water, medical
- **Hotbar** - Quick-use items
- **Inventory organization** - Sort by type, importance
- **Weight/space limits** - Inventory management challenge

## Progression & Survival

### Survival Skill Progression
- **Survival skills** - Get better at surviving over time
- **Efficiency improvements** - Use resources more efficiently
- **Resistance increases** - Better resistance to hazards
- **Knowledge unlocks** - Learn new survival techniques

### Technology & Survival
- **Better gear** - Advanced survival equipment
- **Automation** - Automated food/water production
- **Shelter improvements** - Better bases provide more protection
- **Environmental control** - Control temperature, air quality in bases
