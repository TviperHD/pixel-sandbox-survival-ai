# Automatic Git Commits

## ⚠️ CRITICAL RULE: MANDATORY AUTO-COMMIT

**YOU MUST COMMIT CHANGES IMMEDIATELY AFTER MAKING THEM. THIS IS NOT OPTIONAL.**

**Failure to commit changes is a violation of this rule. Every code change, file creation, or file modification MUST be followed by a Git commit.**

### When to Commit

Commit changes automatically:
- ✅ After implementing a feature or system
- ✅ After fixing a bug
- ✅ After updating documentation
- ✅ After completing a checklist item
- ✅ After making any code changes
- ✅ At the end of a work session
- ✅ Before making major changes

### MANDATORY Commit Process

**After EVERY change you make, you MUST IMMEDIATELY execute these commands:**

```bash
# Step 1: Navigate to project root (if in game/ folder)
cd ..

# Step 2: Check what changed (verify your changes)
git status

# Step 3: Add all changes
git add .

# Step 4: Commit with descriptive message (REQUIRED - never skip this)
git commit -m "Brief description of what was changed"

# Step 5: Push to GitHub (REQUIRED - never skip this)
git push
```

**This is a MANDATORY workflow step. You cannot skip it. You cannot defer it. You must do it immediately after making changes.**

### Commit Message Format

**Use clear, descriptive messages:**

**Good examples:**
- `"Add player movement controller"`
- `"Implement inventory item stacking logic"`
- `"Survival: Add hunger/thirst decay system"`
- `"Fix bug in crafting recipe validation"`
- `"Update technical spec for combat system"`
- `"Phase 1: Complete foundation systems"`

**Bad examples:**
- `"update"` ❌
- `"fix"` ❌
- `"changes"` ❌
- `"stuff"` ❌

**Format guidelines:**
- Use present tense ("Add" not "Added")
- Be specific about what changed
- Include system name if relevant
- Keep it concise (one line preferred)

### Phase Milestones

**When completing a phase, create a milestone tag:**

```bash
# After completing Phase 1
git tag -a phase-1 -m "Phase 1: Foundation Systems Complete"
git push origin phase-1

# After completing Phase 2
git tag -a phase-2 -m "Phase 2: Core Gameplay Systems Complete"
git push origin phase-2

# And so on for each phase...
```

**Available phases:**
- phase-0: Foundation Setup
- phase-1: Foundation Systems
- phase-2: Core Gameplay Systems
- phase-3: World & Environment Systems
- phase-4: AI & Progression Systems
- phase-5: Content Systems
- phase-6: UI/UX Systems
- phase-7: Advanced Systems
- phase-8: Integration & Testing
- phase-9: Polish & Release

### MANDATORY Implementation Pattern

**This is the REQUIRED workflow for EVERY change:**

1. **Make the changes** (edit files, create files, delete files, etc.)
2. **STOP - Do not continue until you commit**
3. **IMMEDIATELY commit (this is MANDATORY):**
   ```bash
   cd ..
   git add .
   git commit -m "Description of changes"
   git push
   ```
4. **Only then continue** working or move to next task

**VIOLATIONS - DO NOT:**
- ❌ Leave changes uncommitted (VIOLATION)
- ❌ Wait to commit until later (VIOLATION)
- ❌ Skip commits (VIOLATION)
- ❌ Commit without pushing (VIOLATION)
- ❌ Make multiple changes before committing (VIOLATION - commit after each change)
- ❌ Say "I'll commit later" (VIOLATION - commit NOW)

**If you make changes, you MUST commit them immediately. There are no exceptions.**

### Example Workflows

**Scenario 1: Implementing a new file**

```bash
# 1. Create inventory_manager.gd
# 2. Write the code
# 3. IMMEDIATELY commit (before doing anything else):
cd ..
git add .
git commit -m "Add inventory manager with add/remove item functions"
git push
# 4. Only then continue with next task
```

**Scenario 2: Editing an existing file**

```bash
# 1. Edit player_controller.gd (add movement function)
# 2. IMMEDIATELY commit (before doing anything else):
cd ..
git add .
git commit -m "Add player movement function to player controller"
git push
# 3. Only then continue with next task
```

**Scenario 3: Multiple related changes**

```bash
# If making multiple related changes, commit after EACH logical unit:
# 1. Create file A
cd ..
git add .
git commit -m "Add file A"
git push

# 2. Create file B
cd ..
git add .
git commit -m "Add file B"
git push

# 3. Edit file C
cd ..
git add .
git commit -m "Update file C"
git push
```

**Remember: Commit frequency is better than committing rarely. Commit after EVERY change.**

**Note:** Manual commits are required for better control over commit messages. Do not use helper scripts.

## Important Notes

- **Commits happen automatically** - Don't skip this step
- **All changes are backed up** - Nothing gets lost
- **Commit history** - Full record of all work
- **Phase milestones** - Easy to track progress

---

## Troubleshooting

**If commit fails:**
- Check you're in project root: `cd ..` from game/ folder
- Verify Git is configured: `git config user.name` and `git config user.email`
- Check GitHub connection: `git remote -v`

**If push fails:**
- Check internet connection
- Verify GitHub credentials
- Check if repository exists on GitHub

---

## Enforcement

**This rule is MANDATORY and CRITICAL. Violations are not acceptable.**

**Checklist - After EVERY change, verify:**
- [ ] Did I make changes? → If YES, proceed to commit
- [ ] Did I run `git add .`? → If NO, do it now
- [ ] Did I run `git commit -m "message"`? → If NO, do it now
- [ ] Did I run `git push`? → If NO, do it now
- [ ] Are there uncommitted changes? → If YES, commit them NOW

**If you find yourself with uncommitted changes, STOP what you're doing and commit them immediately.**

## Remember

**This is a MANDATORY CRITICAL rule. You MUST commit changes automatically after making them. Never leave work uncommitted. There are no exceptions.**
