## CRITICAL RULE: Always Commit Changes

**After making ANY changes to the codebase, you MUST automatically commit them to Git.**

### When to Commit

Commit changes automatically:
- ✅ After implementing a feature or system
- ✅ After fixing a bug
- ✅ After updating documentation
- ✅ After completing a checklist item
- ✅ After making any code changes
- ✅ At the end of a work session
- ✅ Before making major changes

### Commit Process

**After making changes, ALWAYS run these commands:**

```bash
# Navigate to project root (from game/ folder)
cd ..

# Add all changes
git add .

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "Brief description of what was changed"

# Push to GitHub
git push
```

### Commit Message Format

**Use clear, descriptive messages:**

**Good examples:**
- `"Add player movement controller"`
- `"Implement inventory item stacking logic"`
- `"Survival: Add hunger/thirst decay system"`
- `"Fix bug in crafting recipe validation"`
- `"Update technical spec for combat system"`
- `"Phase 1: Complete foundation systems"`

**Bad examples:**
- `"update"` ❌
- `"fix"` ❌
- `"changes"` ❌
- `"stuff"` ❌

**Format guidelines:**
- Use present tense ("Add" not "Added")
- Be specific about what changed
- Include system name if relevant
- Keep it concise (one line preferred)

### Phase Milestones

**When completing a phase, create a milestone tag:**

```bash
# After completing Phase 1
git tag -a phase-1 -m "Phase 1: Foundation Systems Complete"
git push origin phase-1

# After completing Phase 2
git tag -a phase-2 -m "Phase 2: Core Gameplay Systems Complete"
git push origin phase-2

# And so on for each phase...
```

**Available phases:**
- phase-0: Foundation Setup
- phase-1: Foundation Systems
- phase-2: Core Gameplay Systems
- phase-3: World & Environment Systems
- phase-4: AI & Progression Systems
- phase-5: Content Systems
- phase-6: UI/UX Systems
- phase-7: Advanced Systems
- phase-8: Integration & Testing
- phase-9: Polish & Release

### Implementation Pattern

**Every time you make changes:**

1. **Make the changes** (edit files, create files, etc.)
2. **Immediately commit:**
   ```bash
   cd ..
   git add .
   git commit -m "Description of changes"
   git push
   ```
3. **Continue working** or move to next task

**DO NOT:**
- ❌ Leave changes uncommitted
- ❌ Wait to commit until later
- ❌ Skip commits
- ❌ Commit without pushing

### Example Workflow

**Scenario: Implementing inventory system**

```bash
# 1. Create inventory_manager.gd
# 2. Implement functions
# 3. Test it works
# 4. IMMEDIATELY commit:
cd ..
git add .
git commit -m "Implement inventory manager with add/remove item functions"
git push

# 5. Continue with next feature...
```

### Helper Script

**You can use the helper script from game/ folder:**

```powershell
# From game/ folder
cd ..
.\game\auto-commit.ps1 "Description of changes"
```

**But manual commits are preferred for better control over commit messages.**

## Important Notes

- **Commits happen automatically** - Don't skip this step
- **All changes are backed up** - Nothing gets lost
- **Commit history** - Full record of all work
- **Phase milestones** - Easy to track progress

---

## Troubleshooting

**If commit fails:**
- Check you're in project root: `cd ..` from game/ folder
- Verify Git is configured: `git config user.name` and `git config user.email`
- Check GitHub connection: `git remote -v`

**If push fails:**
- Check internet connection
- Verify GitHub credentials
- Check if repository exists on GitHub

---

## Remember

**This is a CRITICAL rule - always commit changes automatically after making them. Never leave work uncommitted!**
