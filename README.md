# Pixel Sandbox Survival AI

**Status:** Researching  
**Type:** Game  
**Created:** 2025-11-24

## Overview

A 2D pixel-art sandbox survival game combining the pixel-level physics and destruction mechanics of Noita with the exploration, building, and survival elements of Terraria. The game features enemies powered by deep learning AI that adapt and learn from player behavior, similar to Arc Raiders' AI training system.

## Project Status

**Current Phase:** Researching

Currently researching:
- Game engine selection (Unity, Godot, Defold, etc.)
- Deep learning/AI frameworks for enemy behavior
- Best practices for combining sandbox survival mechanics
- Technical requirements and architecture

**Next Steps:**
1. ✅ Game engine selected: **Godot**
2. ✅ Research Godot-specific AI/ML integration approaches
3. ✅ Create technical architecture document
4. ✅ Design core gameplay loop
5. ✅ Define world setting (Sci-Fi/Post-Apocalyptic)
6. ✅ Design survival mechanics (harder difficulty, respawn options)
7. ✅ Design AI learning system (hybrid approach)
8. ✅ Research implementation details for all systems
9. ✅ Create detailed technical specifications for systems
10. ✅ Complete technical specifications for all systems
11. ✅ Foundation systems researched and specified in detail
12. **Next:** Begin implementation starting with foundation systems

## Key Decisions

- **Project Name:** pixel-sandbox-survival-ai
- **Core Concept:** 2D pixel sandbox survival with AI-driven enemies
- **Inspiration:** Noita (pixel physics), Terraria (survival), Arc Raiders (AI training)
- **Game Engine:** Godot (selected 2025-11-24)

## Notes

- This is an ambitious project combining complex systems (pixel physics, survival mechanics, and ML-based AI)
- Need to balance performance with advanced AI systems
- Consider starting with simpler AI approaches and evolving to deep learning
- Research ongoing on best engine/framework combinations
- Implementation details documented in `02-research/implementation-research.md`
- All design decisions documented in `05-decisions/decision-log.md`
