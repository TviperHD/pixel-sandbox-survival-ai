# World & Setting

**Date:** 2025-11-24  
**Status:** Planning

## Setting

**Theme:** Sci-Fi / Post-Apocalyptic

A world where advanced technology and catastrophic events have collided, creating a dangerous landscape where survival requires both technological prowess and adaptability.

## World Concept

### Post-Apocalyptic Sci-Fi World
- **Ruins of advanced civilization** - Remnants of high-tech structures and facilities
- **Mutated/evolved threats** - Creatures and entities that have adapted to the harsh environment
- **Scarce resources** - Technology, energy sources, and materials are rare and valuable
- **Hostile environment** - Radiation zones, toxic areas, extreme temperatures
- **Mysterious origins** - What caused the apocalypse? What technology remains?

### Visual Style
- **Pixel art** with sci-fi/post-apocalyptic aesthetic
- **Dark, atmospheric** environments with glowing tech elements
- **Ruined structures** mixed with high-tech facilities
- **Mutated creatures** and robotic enemies
- **Hazardous zones** with visual indicators (radiation, heat, cold)

## Biomes & Environments

### Surface Biomes

1. **Wasteland (Starting Area)**
   - Scattered ruins and debris
   - Moderate resources
   - Basic enemies
   - Extreme temperature variations (day/night)

2. **Radiation Zones**
   - High-tech ruins
   - Valuable tech resources
   - Radiation hazards
   - Stronger enemies
   - Requires protective gear

3. **Desert Wastes**
   - Extreme heat during day
   - Cold nights
   - Scarce water
   - Sandstorms
   - Buried tech caches

4. **Toxic Swamps**
   - Poisonous atmosphere
   - Mutated flora/fauna
   - Unique resources
   - Requires gas masks/filters

5. **Frozen Tundras**
   - Extreme cold
   - Ice caves
   - Cryo-preserved facilities
   - Cold-resistant enemies

### Underground Areas

1. **Subterranean Bunkers**
   - Pre-apocalypse facilities
   - Rich tech resources
   - Security systems (AI-controlled?)
   - Dark, claustrophobic

2. **Underground Caverns**
   - Natural formations
   - Mineral deposits
   - Underground lakes
   - Cave-dwelling creatures

3. **Deep Tech Facilities**
   - Advanced technology
   - Dangerous AI systems
   - High-value loot
   - Complex layouts

### Special Areas

1. **Orbital Stations (Sky)**
   - Vertical exploration
   - Zero-gravity mechanics?
   - Advanced tech
   - Unique challenges

2. **Underwater Facilities**
   - Flooded ruins
   - Water pressure mechanics
   - Aquatic enemies
   - Submerged tech

## World Generation

### Procedural Elements
- **Terrain variation** - Height maps, cave systems
- **Biome distribution** - Logical placement (deserts near equator, tundras at poles?)
- **Structure placement** - Ruins, bunkers, facilities
- **Resource distribution** - Tech, materials, food sources
- **Hazard zones** - Radiation, toxic, extreme temperatures
- **Enemy spawn areas** - Based on biome and difficulty

### Hand-Crafted Elements
- **Key locations** - Important story/quest areas
- **Boss arenas** - Unique combat areas
- **Special structures** - Unique buildings with specific purposes

## Atmosphere & Tone

### Mood
- **Survival-focused** - Constant threat, resource scarcity
- **Mysterious** - What happened? What secrets remain?
- **Isolated** - Lone survivor (or small group) against the world
- **Hopeful** - Despite the danger, progress and rebuilding are possible

### Environmental Storytelling
- **Ruins tell stories** - What happened in this place?
- **Technology remnants** - Clues about the past civilization
- **Enemy behavior** - What are they? Where did they come from?
- **Resource placement** - Why is this valuable tech here?

## Technology Level

### Player Technology
- **Scavenged tech** - Repurposed pre-apocalypse technology
- **Crafted solutions** - Player-built tools and weapons
- **Progressive advancement** - Start primitive, unlock advanced tech
- **Tech trees** - Unlock new capabilities through research/crafting

### World Technology
- **Remaining systems** - Some tech still functional (security, AI, etc.)
- **Broken infrastructure** - Power grids, communication networks (repairable?)
- **Advanced facilities** - High-tech areas with working systems
- **Mysterious tech** - Unexplained advanced technology

## Threats & Dangers

### Environmental Hazards
- **Radiation** - Damages health over time, requires protection
- **Extreme temperatures** - Heat stroke, hypothermia
- **Toxic atmospheres** - Poison damage, requires filters
- **Structural collapse** - Destructible environments can fall
- **Natural disasters** - Sandstorms, earthquakes, etc.

### Enemy Types
- **Mutated creatures** - Evolved wildlife
- **Robotic security** - AI-controlled defense systems
- **Hostile survivors** - Other humans (if applicable)
- **Anomalies** - Unexplained entities
- **Boss entities** - Major threats with unique behaviors

## World Size & Scale

### Scope
- **Large single world** - Expansive map to explore
- **Vertical depth** - Surface, underground, sky
- **Multiple biomes** - Diverse environments
- **Procedural expansion** - World generates as you explore

### Exploration
- **No boundaries** - Explore freely (within performance limits)
- **Chunk-based loading** - Efficient world management
- **Discovery rewards** - Finding new areas provides resources/tech
- **Mapping system** - Track explored areas
